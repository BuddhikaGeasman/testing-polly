## Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
