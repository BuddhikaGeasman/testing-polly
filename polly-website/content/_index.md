He is here. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Red Five standing by. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
