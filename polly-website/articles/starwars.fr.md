Ye-ha! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. You mean it controls your actions? What!?

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. What?! Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?
